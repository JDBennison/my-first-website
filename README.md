# My Very First Website

Welcome!

This was built as part of the learning material for Code Institutes Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website [here](https://jdbennison.github.io/my-first-website/)

## Project description

This project was created to practice my coding skills along with learning the basics of git and github and gitpod. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each section of the program

I am hoping to add on other pages to the Stream 2 and Stream 3 but at the moment I feel confident in my abilities.

## Technologies

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages
